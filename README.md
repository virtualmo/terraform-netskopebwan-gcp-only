# Netskope SD-WAN GW GCP Module

This Infrastructure as Code (IaC) will help you deploy Netskope SD-WAN Gateway in your GCP environment in following scenarios:
- Deploy and activate Netskope SD-WAN Gateway in a new VPC and connect to a new Cloud Router
- Deploy and activate Netskope SD-WAN Gateway in an existing VPC with a new Cloud Router
- Deploy Gateway with multiple WAN links / interfaces
- Optional client deployment for end to end solution validation

This module creates / configures the following objects in GCP and Netskop SD-WAN Portal:

## GCP Cloud
   - VPC per interface (Re-use existing or create new one) 
   - Subnets (always creates new one)
   - Network Connectivity Hub
   - Cloud Router
   - Firewall Rules (For both WAN network and Private network)
   - BGP Peering in Cloud Router to Netskope SD-WAN (This module will provide the actual command to manually execute)
   - Host VPC / VM and required peerings (if chosen)

## Netskope SD-WAN Portal
   - Create new policy
   - Create new gateway (HA deployment is optional)
   - Configure required static routes and BGP peers

## Key Points

- The default username for the gateway is "infiot". Password authentication is disabled and you must use SSH keys to authenticate.
- This module has an option to set the password for the default username "infiot". This will be used only for console access.

## Known Limitations

1) Since terraform provider APIs for Cloud Router has issues when trying to add redundant interfaces, following configurations should be done through CLIs
      * Cloud router interface configuration
      * BGP Peering configuration in GCP

   This terraform module will help you the actual command to be executed when you apply this module.

## Architecture Diagram

This IaC will create the GCP resources as shown below.

## Deployment

To deploy this template in GCP:

- Identify the "Base URL" for your Netskope SD-WAN Tenant. This is a URL that you use to access your Netskope tenant, for example: `https://example.infiot.net`
  This will be set in "netskope_tenant" variable blob

- Get the ID of your Tenant from Netskope Team.

- Create a REST API Token as follows:

- Clone the GitHub repository for this deployment.

- Configure provider block or set variables in the "provider.tf" file.

- Customize variables in the `example.tfvars` and `variables.tf` file as needed.
- Change to the repository directory and then initialize the providers and modules.

   ```sh
   $ cd <Code Directory>
   $ terraform init
    ```
- Submit the Terraform plan to preview the changes Terraform will make to match your configuration.

   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
- Apply the plan. The apply will make no changes to your resources, you can either respond to the confirmation prompt with a 'Yes' or cancel the apply if changes are needed.

   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```

## Destruction

- To destroy this deployment, use the command:

   ```sh
   $ terraform destroy
   ```

## Support

Netskope-provided scripts in this and other GitHub projects do not fall under the regular Netskope technical support scope and are not supported by Netskope support services.
